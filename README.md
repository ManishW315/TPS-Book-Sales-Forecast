# TPS-Book-Sales-Forecast
Exploratory Data Analysis of book sales dataset and predicting the forecast.

The data comes from the Kaggle's tabular playground series september 2022 challenge [TPS](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-sep-2022/data).

The challenge was to predict a full year worth of sales for 4 items from two competing stores located in six different countries. The dataset is completely fictional, but contains many effects you see in real-world data, e.g., weekend and holiday effect, seasonality, etc. You are given the challenging task of predicting book sales during the year 2021.

Additional Composite leading indicator (CLI) data has been taken from [here](https://data.oecd.org/leadind/composite-leading-indicator-cli.htm)
